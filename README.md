# 🛠️ Monorepo for CI/CD & Cert Management Study

Yo! This is my personal monorepo where I'm exploring and learning about **CI/CD**, **SSL Certificate Management**, **PM2**, and **Nginx** deployment stuff.

## 🌿 Branches

- `main`: Main development stuff.
- `production`: Stable and production-ready code.

## ⚙️ What's Inside?

This repo is mainly for practice and testing, nothing too fancy (yet 😎). Here's what I'm playing with:

### 🚀 CI/CD

- Trying out automated deployments using GitHub Actions and bash scripts.
- Testing out basic build + deploy pipelines from `main` to `production`.

### 🔐 Certificate Management

- Learning to generate and renew SSL certificates using **Let's Encrypt** + **Certbot**.
- Using Nginx for SSL termination.

### 🌀 PM2

- Using **PM2** to manage Node.js processes.
- Helps keep stuff running even after crashes or restarts.

### 🌐 Nginx

- Reverse proxy setup using **Nginx**.
- Handles SSL and routes traffic to PM2-managed services.

## 🧪 Just for Study!

This monorepo is purely for **learning and testing purposes** — not production-grade (yet 😉).
